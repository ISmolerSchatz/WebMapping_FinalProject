# WebMapping_FinalProject

# Topic:
Philly's Indego Bike Stations

# Tools and Skills:
My final project uses mapbox and builds off of skills we learned from the US State population density map we made for module 8. This project also includes creating additional user controls for zoom and popups when markers are clicked. The colors were chosen based on a combination of the Indego logo and Septa logo.
